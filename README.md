# Config-Rice

This repo contains my config files. They are only tested in my machines, read them before using them.
This should not be taken as how a dwm build should look like. The rabbit hole of LINUX rice is too deep, this build takes usability over looks.

## The system

These configs were my approach to Luke Smith's old scholl i3-gaps configs. I think that i3 is a great starting point if you want to get into tiling window managers. Once you get used to the workflow, dwm seems like a better alternative to me, it is so light and writen in C!
